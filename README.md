# Timecard Project #


hi eric I added a dashboard.
used streamlit, lots of potential to do some cool stuff
I've split into multiple pages so we can have different visualizations per page<br />

How to run as of now
	- Rerun requirements.txt to download new streamlit dependencies <br />
	- Go to dashboard folder and open terminal <br /> 
 	- Run the command: streamlit run main.py <br />
