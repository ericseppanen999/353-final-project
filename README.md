# Timecard Project #


hi eric I added a dashboard.
used streamlit, lots of potential to do some cool stuff
I've split into multiple pages so we can have different visualizations per page

How to run as of now
	- Rerun requirements.txt to download new streamlit dependencies
	- Go to dashboard folder and open terminal
  - Run the command: streamlit run main.py
